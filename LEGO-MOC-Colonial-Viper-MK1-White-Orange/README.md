# Some Comments on the Spare Parts

The last few pages of the instructions list some spare parts, they can be used for:

- 2 pieces of: 1x1 white tile, to replace the navigation lights at the end of the wings

- 4 pieces of: 1x1 dark bluish grey plate, to create sort of "wing marker/signature", as can be seen on the above mentioned photos, so that #1 and #2 Vipers can be distinguished

- 2 pieces of: 1x3 white brick, to remove the "wing marker/signature" parts, and to replace the **1 piece of 1x2 white brick** and **3 pieces of 1x1 white plate**, where the "wing marker/signature" is suggested
